**Netactview** is a graphical network connections viewer for Linux, similar in functionality with Netstat. It includes features like process information, host name retrieval, automatic refresh, sorting, filtering and csv file save. It has a fully featured GTK 2 graphical interface.  

This is an alternative project repository kept in sync with the main repository on sourceforge:

I need competent and trustable partners to help continue Netactview. Due to an unknown health condition I don't expect to be able to create a proper updated version of Netactview. While I am not aware of required critical patches at the moment, the application needs normal updates to avoid becoming obsolete.
